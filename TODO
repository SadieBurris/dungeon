- Things as locations.

- Give objects a default place on the player (in bag, on finger, etc.)

- Possibly differential damage for weapon/monster pairs.

- Description class to deal with word wrapping, commafying, lists, etc.

- Notion of turns within room so attacks can change or only start after a certain turn.

- Add LCS error correction for not understood words.

- When a thing is in another thing, the enclosing thing should control whether
  you can take it. (E.g. you can take the parrot from the pirate if the pirate
  is weak or dead.)

- TAKE should support 'take a and b', 'take a, b, and c', etc. (Probably by
  having a list parser.)

- Improve description of things with things, perhaps using some standard places.
  "THERE IS A WOODEN TABLE ON WHICH IS A LOAF OF BREAD" rather than "THERE IS A
  WOODEN TABLE. ON THE TABLE IS A LOAF OF BREAD."
