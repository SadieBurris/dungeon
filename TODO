- TAKE should support 'take a and b', 'take a, b, and c', etc. (Probably by

  you can take it. (E.g. you can take the parrot from the pirate if the pirate
  is weak or dead.)

  "IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THERE IS A WOODEN TABLE ON WHICH IS A LOAF OF
  BREAD" or even better "THERE IS A LOAF OF BREAD ON A WOODEN TABLE IN THE
  MIDDLE OF THE ROOM" rather than "THERE IS A WOODEN TABLE. ON THE TABLE IS A
  LOAF OF BREAD."
